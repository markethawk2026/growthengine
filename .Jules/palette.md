## 2025-05-18 - Dynamic ARIA Labels for State-Toggling Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (such as theme toggles or chat send buttons) are inaccessible to screen readers without `aria-label` and `title` attributes. When state changes (e.g., toggling dark/light mode), static labels become inaccurate and confusing.
**Action:** Always provide initial `aria-label` and `title` attributes on icon-only buttons in HTML, and dynamically update `aria-label` and `title` in JavaScript event handlers to accurately reflect the next state/action available to the user.
